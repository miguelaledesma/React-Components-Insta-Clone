# React-Components-Insta-Clone

## Composing React Components and Passing Data Via Props

## Introduction

- In this project, I built a simple Instagram clone using React.
- There is a file called `dummy-data.js` that contains some mock data. Each object in the mock data represents a faux Instagram post.
- The React application received faux post data and render each as a separate Instagram post.
